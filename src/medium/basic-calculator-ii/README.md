# 227. Basic Calculator II

Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value.

The integer division should truncate toward zero.



Example 1:

Input: s = "3+2*2"
Output: 7
Example 2:

Input: s = " 3/2 "
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: s = " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consists of integers and operators ('+', '-', '*', '/') separated by some number of spaces.
s represents a valid expression.
All the integers in the expression are non-negative integers in the range [0, 231 - 1].
The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
